# My Linux Post-Install Script

This script is intended to be run on a fresh Kubuntu installation. Other distros may not work. It will install the [Oh My Zsh Shell](https://ohmyz.sh/), some tools, apply [my VIM settings](https://github.com/dm432/vim) and configure some other things. You should probably not use it without looking through it, and instead create your own script based on mine if you wish.
## 🔧 How to use
 
To execute the post install script, just run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dm432/post-install/main/install.sh | bash
```
